# Speech-Emotion-Recognition 

This project focuses on Speech Emotion Recognition through advanced Deep Learning and Neural Network techniques. The primary goal of the project was to accurately identify and classify emotions conveyed in speech. Through extensive research and experimentation, we developed a model that achieved an impressive accuracy rate of approximately 81%, showcasing its potential for real-world applications in emotion recognition.
